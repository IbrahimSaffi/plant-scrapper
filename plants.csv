Acmena smithii,The lilly pilly is fairly hardy and needs only a subtropical climate to flourish. Protection should be given from long or hard freezes.,"Plants enjoy profuse amounts of water but will grow in drier areas, and grow best in areas of light sun or shade. Plant in well-drained soil."
Actinidia arguta,"The hardy kiwifruit is very hardy (hence the name), and can survive slow temperature drops to -25F.","The vines need a frost-free growing season of about 150 days, but are not damaged by late freezes. The vines can also be grown in low-chill areas."
Actinidia chinensis,Kiwi's are fairly hardy and can survive to 10-15F.,"Grow in well drained soil. Fruiting occurs on mature growth (at least a year old), and slows on old wood (over 3 years). Plants are male or female, so cross pollination is necessary for fruit set. For backyard culture, it can be common to grow several vines together in a clump in order to ensure both sexes. The golden kiwi is very similar to the green kiwi (Actinidia deliciosa) in growth patterns and outward appearance."
Actinidia deliciosa,Kiwi's are fairly hardy and can survive to 10-15F.,"Grow in well drained soil. Fruiting occurs on mature growth (at least a year old), and slows on old wood (over 3 years). Plants are male or female, so cross pollination is necessary for fruit set. For backyard culture, it can be common to grow several vines together in a clump in order to ensure both sexes. Sex can be determined once plants mature and begin flowering. There is no way to differentiate sexes from seeds."
Adansonia digitata,"Hardy to at least 30F, though trees will quickly defoliate and die back once temperatures drop below 40F.",The baobab grows best in frost-free climates. Grow in well-drained soil. It is highly drought tolerant once established. Do not allow water-logged soil or standing water. Grow in full sun.
Aegle marmelos,Survives a wide temperature range from 20-120F.,"Bael Fruit's easily withstands long periods of drought, which are needed for better fruit yields. It grows in most soil and climate types, and requires little care when established."
Aiphanes aculeata,Unknown.,Unknown.
Aleurites moluccana,Candlenut trees are somewhat hardy and will survive temperatures to 25-28F.,"They grow very well in tropical climates with ample rainfall, but also adapt to dry climates. Candlenut's need little if any care after they are established."
Aleurites trisperma,Hardy to the upper 20's (F).,"Grows well in tropical and subtropical areas, and should succeed where the candlenut can."
Alibertia edulis,Unknown.,Unknown.
